# Extensible Pieces
The MJQM simulator is designed to be an extensible framework that allows users to easily customize and enhance its functionality.

Before diving into the details, you should become a bit familiar with the simulator's architecture.
A description of the main components and their interactions can be found in the [Project structure](extend/structure.md) section.

Then, you can check on the main extensible pieces of the simulator:

- [Policies](extend/policies.md)
- [Distributions](extend/distributions.md)
- [Statistics](extend/statistics.md)
- [Output columns](extend/output_columns.md)
- [Visualizations](extend/visualizations.md)
